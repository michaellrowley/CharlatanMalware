# CharlatanMalware
This program appends strings from one file to a duplicated version of itself, I developed it to test the principles shown in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pwMCHlNma4) video (bypassing/triggering antiviruses based on static string-based signatures) but didn't find anything too interesting.

Usage:

Use the below syntax to have CharlatanMalware extract all (UNICODE or ASCII) strings from ``mimikatz.exe`` and append it to a duplicated version of ``CharlatanMalware.exe`` located at ``output_file.exe``.

``CharlatanMalware.exe mimikatz.exe output_file.exe``

A similar output could be achieved by dragging ``mimikatz.exe`` onto ``CharlatanMalware.exe`` in ``explorer.exe``.

When testing your antivirus, static scanning might be insufficient - if you need to run the duplicated version of ``CharlatanMalware.exe``, just double click it or execute it with no arguments provided, this will spawn it in a 'dummy' mode that does nothing while letting antivirus solutions scan it.
